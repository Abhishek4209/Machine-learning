It depends on the specific problem, the quality of the base models, and the computational resources available. A common rule of thumb is to start with an ensemble size that is large enough to see a significant reduction in variance (improved generalization) compared to a single model but not so large that it becomes computationally prohibitive. Typically, ensemble sizes between 10 and 100 base models are common."
