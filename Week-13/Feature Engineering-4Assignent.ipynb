    "\n",
    "##### Suppose you are building a machine learning model to classify movies into different genres based on various features, including genre information. The genre attribute contains categories such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, Science Fiction, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### One-Hot Encoding Approach:\n",
    "###### If you were to use one-hot encoding for the genre attribute, you would create a binary column for each genre category. In this example, with around 20 or more genres, you would end up with 20 or more binary columns. If a movie belongs to multiple genres, many of these columns would be set to 1, making the dataset very sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The issues with one-hot encoding in this scenario are:\n",

    "##### High Dimensionality: The number of columns grows with the number of unique genres, making the dataset high-dimensional.\n",
