Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques, making it useful for feature selection and preventing overfitting. Here are several common strategies for dealing with missing values when using Elastic Net Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.Data Imputation:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean/Median Imputation: Replace missing values in a feature with the mean or median of that feature. This is a simple and commonly used method but may not be suitable for all cases.\n",
    "#### Mode Imputation: For categorical variables, you can replace missing values with the mode (most frequent category).\n",
    "#### Regression Imputation: Use other features to predict the missing values through regression techniques. For example, you can build a regression model to predict missing values based on other variables.\n",
    "### **2.Dropping Missing Values:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the proportion of missing values is small and randomly distributed, you may choose to remove the rows with missing values. However, this approach can lead to loss of information and potential bias in your model.\n",
    "### **3.Flagging Missing Values:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Create a binary indicator variable that takes the value 1 if a value is missing and 0 if it is not. This can help the model learn if missingness is informative.**\n",
    "### **4.Multiple Imputation:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Use more advanced techniques like Multiple Imputation. This involves creating multiple imputed datasets with different imputed values and running the regression on each dataset. The results are then combined to obtain more robust estimates.**"
